how_add: How can I add SpamWatch to my group?
answer_how_add: >-
  *SpamWatch* is what's known as a "Rose Fed". Using @MissRoseBot you can connect to the SpamWatch Federation, allowing any _fedbans_ that happen
  in SpamWatch to also affect your connected group or groups. To connect to SpamWatch:


  1. Add @MissRoseBot to your group and give it admin permissions.


  2. Run the command `/joinfed 1c2221d9-aa27-4baf-b77c-8822b36254d2` to be connected to the SpamWatch Federation.


  And that's all there is to it. Your group is now connected to SpamWatch.

how_report: How can I report spam to SpamWatch?
answer_how_report: >-
  There are multiple kinds of spam, and therefore also multiple different ways to report it.
  

  The simplest way is to just *forward* the spam messages here. Any forwarded messages will be forwarded on to our team for analysis. 


  Another big problem is groups *spam adding* people. If you get spam added to a group or see it happening in a group you're in, use
  the command `/spam @groupusername` or `/spam invite_link`. This won't work for private groups without an invite link.


  If you see a group or user spreading *child abuse* content, use the command `/ca @username` or `/ca invite_link`.


  If you notice another kind of spam that wasn't mentioned here please let us know in @SpamWatchSupport so we can get it added.

why_banned: Why was I banned?
answer_why_banned: >-
  There are several possible reasons you may have been banned in *SpamWatch*. Did you:


  - Send a *spam message* in a group? A spam message can be anything others might find annoying such as
  advertisements, cryptocurrency promotions, telegram group/channel promotions, and much more.


  - Flood a group with *useless*, *vulgar*, or otherwise *annoying messages*?


  - *Add people* to a group or channel without their permission?


  While these aren't the only ways to be banned in SpamWatch, they are the main ones. If you're an admin
  in a group that is mass adding members *you may also be subject to a ban*!

can_i_get_unbanned: Can I get unbanned?
answer_can_i_get_unbanned: >-
  The short answer is, *probably not*. The auto-ban system, also called _autobahn_, is very efficient and
  very rarely gets things wrong. That being said, occasionally misunderstandings happen, so here is a list
  of offenses for which you _might_ be pardoned:

  
  - Being an admin in a group that is mass adding people. This is *only* if you did not participate in the
  mass adding, and you agree to leave the offending group.


  - General spam, _if_ you can prove that the spam in question was a misunderstanding. For instance, some
  links are blacklisted and will result in an automatic fedban. If you happend to post one of these
  links for some other purpose it _could_ result in an accidental ban.


  In general however, just know, if you *did* spam you will not be unbanned. SpamWatch bans do not have a time limit.
